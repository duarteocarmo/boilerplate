# Duarte's boilerplate

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template I use to kickstart python projects.

'Cause writing boilerplate is boring.

## Installation

Make sure you have cookiecutter installed:

```shell
$ pipx install cookiecutter
```

Then create your project:

```shell
$ pipx run cookiecutter gh:duarteocarmo/boilerplate
```

Enjoy.
